# One paragraph comparing TDD to your previous development approach.

When i used TDD, i wrote tests first, but tests was bad, because i didn't know how code should be written.
So after i wrote code, i realized that i need to rewrite tests.
When i rewrited tests, i realized that i need to rewrite code.
So i wrote code, and tests again.
And so on.

This approach fits bad to me, because i have no clear vision of how code should be before i write it.
I prefer to write code first, and then write tests.

But TDD may be really useful when you have documented good architecture and good design in details.
So it will be easier to write tests before code, because you will have a clear vision of how code should be.
