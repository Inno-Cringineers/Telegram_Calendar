| CON-1 | Users must interact with the system through a Telegram bot interface in private chat mode.                                                                                                                                |
| CON-2 | The system must be self-hosted by end-users using Docker Compose.                                                                                                                                                         |
| CON-3 | The MVP must be delivered by December 19, 2025. Self-hosting setup must be achievable within 40 minutes by a test user following the provided README files.                                                               |
| CON-4 | The system must synchronize with external calendars via the iCal (ICS) standard                                                                                                                                           |
| CON-5 | The system must support localization in Russian and English languages. All user-facing messages, notifications, and reminders must be available in both languages.                                                        |
| CON-6 | The system must support single-user per instance. The first user who contacts the bot becomes the primary user, and the bot must only respond to commands from this registered user ID.                                   |
| CON-7 | The system must persist all data (events, reminders, user settings, and authorization state) and automatically recover within 5 minutes after system failure, crash, or server reboot. Zero data loss must be guaranteed. |
| CON-8 | The project must use the MIT license and be open-source.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| CON-9 | The user can perform CRUD operations only on those events that were created through the bot interface.                                                                                                                    |
