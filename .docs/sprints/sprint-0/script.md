# Questions:

Who are the users, stakeholders?

Have you some user stories scenario? 

What main features you want to see?

Interface should be only telegram bot interface or we need web app?

Do we need feature that bot showing all events? or only notification sending?

Do we need CRUD operations with calendar events? 

The bot should write in private messages to the user or in group chats, to which the chat owner will add it?

Do need to set the frequency of notifications (including how long before the event the notifications should arrive)?

There is two ways to do integration of calendars:

- using ical link to calendar (the user will have to log into the calendar he uses, copy the ics link from there and paste it to bot)

- The user will be able to log in to their calendar account via a bot (for example, via a web app), but if we want this functionality - we need to determ ine which calendars the bot will integrate with

Do we need voice input, AI integration?

Which languages bot must to support?

Do we need setting where user specify time zone?

Do we need to user able mute bot for a while?

Do we need to sending daily plans (events list on today)?

What additional requirements you have?
